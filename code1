From the Ukraine peace talks to countless trade wars, Trump continues to be just as loved and hated as ever with the old order only continuing to be destroyed brick by brick.<br><br>Now, two veterans, two traitors to their parties, will face off in an unprecedented election. Former Reagan Republican Adam Kinzinger must fight former Bernie Bro Tulsi Gabbard for the nation's future and indeed their parties. With the old political order completely upheaved and partisan stalwarts as confused as ever, many now wonder if this is the burning down of the old system or the grand creation of a new one.\n",

With donors already lining up to support him and his opponents being seen as too radical, Kinzinger may be able to mold his new party into a truly patriotic party.\n</p>",

Her abandonment of her party and support of Donald Trump’s reelection campaign surprised little as did her procurement of a cozy position in his administration as National Security Advisor.<br><br>Now she has announced her intention to run as the GOP’s next nominee for the presidency. In a sea of many bland conservatives, Gabbard must tap into the MAGA base and excite them in a way not seen since 2016. However, the RNC and its cronies are well-funded, organized, and established and will not take too kindly to her takeover. Gabbard had been here before and would make sure this time her revolution would succeed.\n\n</p>",
